SPACE COMPLEXITY

Space Complexity: How much more memory use (RAM) do we need as the inputs provided to the Code get larger?

-------------------------------
SPACE COMPLEXITY RULES OF THUMB
-------------------------------
-Storing values in variables always takes up memory
-Most Primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined, null) take up O(1) /Constant Space
-Strings, Reference Types( Arrays, and Objects) take up O(n) /Linear Space
